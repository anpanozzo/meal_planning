# Problem(s)

I need to eat 150g of protein per day for lean body composition and glowing skin, but it's time-consuming to find recipes that taste good, match my cooking skills, AND actually deliver the protein and skin-healthy nutrients I need. Right now I only know how to make things that may or may not get me those results.

# Goals

- less than 20% body fat (quantitative)
- radiant skin (qualitative)

# Why Now

- Lack confidence in body
- Jeans fitting tighter
- Highest weight on the scale in lifetime

# Solution

Build a curated recipe collection where each recipe is evaluated and tagged for:
- Protein content (aiming for 150g/day total across 3 meals + 1 snack)
- Skin-healthy ingredients (collagen-supporting, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant-rich)
- Taste and flavor (warm, satisfying, enjoyable)
- Cooking skill match (recipes I know how to make or can learn easily)

Then generate one day meal plans (3 meals + 1 snack) from this trusted collection that I know will deliver results.

# Files to Create

- [ ] **Recipe Database** - Source of truth with recipe data needed to get results
- [ ] **Daily Menu Template** - Sharable format for 3 meals + 1 snack

# Recipe Database Structure

## For hitting 150g protein/day:
- Recipe name
- Protein per serving (grams)
- Serving size
- Total calories
- Carbs (g), Fat (g) - optional but helpful

## For glowing skin:
- Skin-healthy: Yes/No
- Skin benefits tags: (collagen-supporting, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant-rich, omega-3, vitamin C, hydrating)
- Key skin ingredients: (specific foods like salmon, berries, leafy greens, etc.)

## For usability:
- Recipe URL
- Meal type: (breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack)
- Cooking time
- Difficulty: (easy, medium, hard)
- Flavor profile: (warm & comforting, light & fresh, etc.)
- GF/DF compatible: Yes/No
- Notes: (any adjustments needed)

---

# Requirements 
- Meal plan summary should be short 
- Meal plan should include a list of the instructions for prep 
- Generate a list of ingrendients to shop. Make it compatible with Apple reminders app
- Create a source of truth file likely CSV or MD that holds foods to make as well as their caloric and macro makeup and URLs
- Allow user to send an email to of the menu recap 
- Menu recap should be only the title of the meal, the URL (if available) amount of protein and if its glowing skin (what do I need to research for glowing skin?)
