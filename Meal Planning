# Problem(s)

It is time-consuming and a lot of mental calories to change eating patterns to optimize protein intake with meals I enjoy eating. 

# Goals 

- less than 20% body fat (quantitative)
- radiant skin (qualitative) 
 
# Why Now 

- Lack confidence in body 
- Jeans fitting tigheter 
- Highest weight on the scale in lifetime 

# Solution 
- Generate a one day meal plan that includes 3 meals in a day and one snack


# Requirements 
- Meal plan summary should be short 
- Meal plan should include a list of the instructions for prep 
- Generate a list of ingrendients to shop. Make it compatible with Apple reminders app
- Create a source of truth file likely CSV or MD that holds foods to make as well as their caloric and macro makeup and URLs
- Allow user to send an email to of the menu recap 
- Menu recap should be only the title of the meal, the URL (if available) amount of protein and if its glowing skin (what do I need to research for glowing skin?)
