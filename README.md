# Overview 
Meal planning is time-consuming and repetitive. It's also unique to each person. How might I create a meal planning workout tailored to my own needs?

# Problem
I need to eat 150g of protein per day for lean body composition and glowing skin, but it's time-consuming to find recipes that taste good, match my cooking skills and eating preferances, while delivering the protein and skin-healthy nutrients I need. Right now I only know how to make things that may or may not get me those results.
